Security headers are HTTP headers that provide additional layers of security to web applications 
by controlling how browsers handle certain aspects of the page's behavior. These headers help 
protect against various web vulnerabilities and enhance overall security. Here are some common 
security headers and their explanations:

1. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):**
   - This header instructs the browser to only connect to the website over HTTPS, even if 
   the user enters "http" in the address bar. It helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by 
   enforcing a secure connection.
   - Implementation in Node.js (using Express):

     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const helmet = require('helmet');

     const app = express();
     app.use(helmet.strictTransportSecurity({ maxAge: 31536000, includeSubDomains: true }));
     ```

2. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):**
   - CSP defines a set of rules that specify which content (e.g., scripts, styles, images) can 
   be executed or loaded by the browser. It helps mitigate the risks of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
   attacks.
   - Implementation in Node.js:

     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const helmet = require('helmet');

     const app = express();
     app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
         directives: {
             defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
             scriptSrc: ["'self'", 'trusted-scripts.com'],
             // other directives as needed
         },
     }));
     ```

3. **X-Content-Type-Options:**
   - This header prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type than declared
    by the server. It helps mitigate MIME-sniffing attacks.
   - Implementation in Node.js:

     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const helmet = require('helmet');

     const app = express();
     app.use(helmet.noSniff());
     ```

4. **X-Frame-Options:**
   - This header prevents a page from being embedded in an iframe, which can help mitigate 
   clickjacking attacks.
   - Implementation in Node.js:

     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const helmet = require('helmet');

     const app = express();
     app.use(helmet.frameguard({ action: 'deny' }));
     ```

5. **Referrer-Policy:**
   - This header controls how much referrer information is included with requests. It helps
    protect user privacy by limiting the information sent to other sites.
   - Implementation in Node.js:

     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const helmet = require('helmet');

     const app = express();
     app.use(helmet.referrerPolicy({ policy: 'same-origin' }));
     ```

To implement these security headers in a Node.js application, you'll need to use a middleware
 like `helmet`. Install it using:

```bash
npm install helmet
```

Then, include it in your Express application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const helmet = require('helmet');

const app = express();

// Use helmet middleware to set security headers
app.use(helmet());

// ... other middleware and routes

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Adjust the configurations based on your specific security requirements and the headers you want 
to enable. Always refer to the official documentation of the security headers and the `helmet` 
middleware for the most up-to-date information.

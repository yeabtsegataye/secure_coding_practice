Buffer overflows hacks
//////////////////////////
One of the most serious input attacks is a buffer overflow that specifically targets 
input fields in web applications. A credit-reporting application, for example, might 
authenticate users before they’re allowed to submit data or pull reports. The login
 form uses the following code to grab user IDs with a maximum input of 12 characters, 
 as denoted by the maxsize variable:

URL manipulation hacks
/////////////////////////
An automated input attack manipulates a URL and sends it back to the server, telling 
the web application to do various things, such as redirect to third-party sites or load 
sensitive files from the server. Local file inclusion is one such vulnerability.
 This vulnerability occurs when the web application accepts URL-based input and 
 returns the specified file’s contents to the user, as in the following example of
  an attempted breach of a Linux server’s passwd file:

Hidden field manipulation hacks
//////////////////
Some websites and applications embed hidden fields in web pages to pass state information
 between the web server and the browser. Hidden fields are represented in a web form as . 
 Because of poor coding practices, hidden fields often contain confidential information 
 (such as product prices on an e-commerce site) that should be stored only in a back-end database.
  Users shouldn't see hidden fields (hence, the name), but a curious attacker can discover and
   exploit them.

Code injection and SQL injection hacks
///////////////////////////////
Code injection can also be carried out against back-end SQL databases in an attack known as 
SQL injection. Malicious hackers insert SQL statements — such as CONNECT, SELECT, and UNION 
— into URL requests to attempt to connect and extract information from the SQL database that
 the web application interacts with. SQL injection is made possible by applications' failure 
 to validate input properly combined with informative errors returned from database servers 
 and web servers.

Cross-site scripting hacks
//////////////////////
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is perhaps the best-known and most-widespread web vulnerability 
that occurs when a web page displays user input — typically via JavaScript — that isn’t 
validated properly. A hacker can take advantage of the absence of input filtering and cause 
a web page to execute malicious code on any computer that views the page.

Countermeasures against input attacks
///////////////////
Websites and applications must filter incoming data. The sites and applications must ensure 
that the data entered fits within the parameters that the application is expecting. If the data
 doesn’t match, the application should generate an error or return to the previous page. Under 
 no circumstances should the application accept the junk data, process it, and reflect it to the user.
